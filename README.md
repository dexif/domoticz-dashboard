# Dashboard for Domoticz

Flexible dashboard for Domoticz for devices with touch interfaces
This project is based on ideas of HADashboard. HADashboard was originally created by [FlorianZ](https://github.com/FlorianZ/hadashboard) for use with the SmartThings Home Automation system, with notable contributions from the [SmartThings Community](https://community.smartthings.com/t/home-automation-dashboard/4926).
